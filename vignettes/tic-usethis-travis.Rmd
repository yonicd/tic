```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The following diagram shows how the packages *tic*, *travis* and *usethis* are connected:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', dpi = 60}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tic-travis-usethis.png")
```

The *usethis* package holds all the utility wrapper functions to simplify R package development.
From cloning a GitHub repo (`create_from_github()`) over using `roxygen2` for documentation purposes (`use_roxygen()`) to setting up CI for your package (`use_ci()`).
The latter effectively calls a mixture of *travis* and *tic* functions that do the work in the background. 

Most of the work that needs to be done for Travis is handled by the *travis* package. 
These are tasks like enabling the repo in [travis-ci.org](travis-ci.org), setting up SSH deployment keys for your repo on Travis and others.

After everything is set up, *usethis* and *travis* have done their jobs and the rest of the work goes to *tic*.
By this we mean the handling of the actual CI workflow: Which steps are going to be run, how the deployment is handled and so on.

In summary, the interaction is as follows:

- *usethis*: Package containing utility wrapper functions to simplify R package development, including `use_ci()`.

- *travis*: Responsible for setting up all CI related tasks and taking care of permissions.

- *tic*: Package to specify the CI workflow (which stages are run, which commands are used).

# Running steps conditionally

Steps and stages can be run conditionally using the control workflow of _tic_.
Possible conditionals are

- Environment variables of the build (queried by `Sys.getenv()`)
- R Version of the current build (`getRversion()`)
- other features of the build (e.g. branch name, `ci_get_branch()`)

The most common use cases are the testing on multiple R versions and the restriction of certain tasks that should only be executed once (e.g. the [deployment of a _pkgdown_ site](deployment.html#pkgdown-deployment)).
If you test on multiple CI services you may also want to run certain tasks on only one of them.

## Use cases

The following shows you some example code blocks to condition certain stages and their respective steps on 

- the R Version (using an env variable)
- the CI service
- a specific branch

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (Sys.getenv("TRAVIS_R_VERSION_STRING") == "release") {
  get_stage("after_success") %>%
    add_step(<do something>)
}
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (inherits(ci(), "TravisCI") {
  get_stage(<a stage>) %>%
    add_step(<do something>)
}
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (ci_get_branch() == "master") {
  get_stage(<a stage>) %>%
    add_step(<do something>)
}
```

# Installing packages

Note that manual installation of GitHub or CRAN packages should only be used in non-interactive CI runs. 
This can be checked with the condition `ci_is_interactive()`.

Usually required packages should be installed based on the DESCRIPTION file of a package.
You should only use the following steps in extraordinary circumstances.

## GitHub packages

GitHub packages should be installed in the `install` stage:

```{r eval = FALSE}
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_step(step_install_github("r-lib/rcmdcheck"))
```

Note that the underlying `remotes::install_github()` is vectorized for the `repo` argument which means you can pass all packages you want to install in a single function call: `add_step(step_install_github(c("r-lib/rcmdcheck", "r-lib/usethis")))`.

## CRAN packages

Sometimes you need to install CRAN packages that are not specified in the DESCRIPTION file of your package.
For example, to create a favicon in _pkgdown_, the `magick` package is required.
To install the package (only if it does not exist in the cache already), run the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_step(step_install_cran("magick"))
```

# CI Meta-Information

The `ci()` function holds valuable information about the CI system. 
It can be used to query information that can be again be utilized for conditioning stages or steps.

For example, the user may wish to only deploy on Travis by using `inherits(ci(), "TravisCI")`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (inherits(ci(), "TravisCI")) {
  get_stage("before_deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_setup_ssh())

  get_stage("deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_push_deploy())
}
```

See `?ci` for more information on which information can be extracted from this function.

# Troubleshooting: Running tic locally

*tic* can be emulated locally in two ways:

## Check for syntax errors

You can run check on possible syntax errors in `tic.R` using `dsl_load()`.
This function will just source `tic.R` to check for possible misspecification errors.
If everything is ok, it will return a list with all stages that are run in the CI build, formatted in the `R6` class style.
Here is a preview of the first two stages:
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
dsl_load()[1:2]
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
$before_install
<Stage>
  Public:
    add_step: function (step, code) 
    add_task: function (run, check = NULL, prepare = NULL, name = NULL) 
    clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
    initialize: function (name) 
    prepare_all: function () 
    reset: function () 
    run_all: function () 
  Private:
    name: before_install
    prepare_one: function (step) 
    run_one: function (step) 
    steps: list

$install
<Stage>
  Public:
    add_step: function (step, code) 
    add_task: function (run, check = NULL, prepare = NULL, name = NULL) 
    clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
    initialize: function (name) 
    prepare_all: function () 
    reset: function () 
    run_all: function () 
  Private:
    name: install
    prepare_one: function (step) 
    run_one: function (step) 
    steps: list
```

## Emulate a CI run locally

To emulate a real CI run locally, you can call `run_all_stages()` and the stages and steps will be executed in your local R console.
Note that doing this will of course use your local system libraries and not the CI environment.

Also some steps will not be executed as they are conditioned to run on non-interactive environments only, e.g. `add_step(covr::codcov())` added by `do_package_checks()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tic::run_all_stages()
Running script: step_rcmdcheck(warnings_are_errors = warnings_are_errors, notes_are_errors = notes_are_errors, args = args, build_args = build_args)

# Troubleshooting: Entering the CI build

If your Travis build fails and you don't understand why (error messages are too unspecific, you cannot reproduce the problem locally), you can ssh into the Travis build via SSH.
To do so, your repository must be enabled for "ssh debugging".
This means you need to write the Travis CI team an e-mail, asking whether your repo can be [activated for debugging](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/running-build-in-debug-mode/#enabling-debug-mode).
Usually you get a reply within one day including additional information.
However, rather than going the manual way, just take the easy route by calling `travis::travis_debug_job()`.

All it needs is the "Job ID" of the respective build you want to enter.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', dpi = 50}
knitr::include_graphics("img/travis-job-id.png")
```

Rather than going to the web interface and getting the "Job ID" there, you can also do it from the command line.
First, you need to query the overall "Build ID" of the run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
travis::travis_get_builds()
```

```{sh eval = FALSE}
A collection of 25 Travis CI builds:
- id: 416858821, number: 342, state: errored, duration: 3820, event_type: push, ...
- id: 416834229, number: 341, state: errored, duration: 3738, event_type: push, ...
- id: 416135954, number: 340, state: errored, duration: 3338, event_type: push, ...
- id: 416107143, number: 339, state: errored, duration: 3670, event_type: push, ...
- id: 416095854, number: 338, state: passed, duration: 3135, event_type: push, ...
```

Because every "build" has multiple "Jobs", you can now query the "Job ID".
For example, when you know that you want to debug the latest build, you can combine both commands:

```{r eval = FALSE}
build_id <- travis::travis_get_builds()[[1]]$id
travis::travis_get_jobs(build_id)
```

```{sh eval = FALSE}
A collection of 7 Travis CI jobs:
- id: 416858822, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.1, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:52Z, ...
- id: 416858823, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.2, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:18Z, ...
- id: 416858824, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.3, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:43Z, ...
- id: 416858825, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.4, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:23Z, ...
- id: 416858826, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.5, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:23Z, ...
```

Finally, the build can be restarted by calling `travis::travis_debug_job()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
job_id <- travis::travis_get_jobs(build_id)[[1]]$id
travis::travis_debug_job(job_id)
```

```{sh eval = FALSE}
Finished restarting debug job 416983664 from Travis CI.
```

Wait a few minutes until the build arrives at the point when it shows the SSH command that can be used to ssh into the build.
It should look similar to `ssh ukjiuCEkxBBnRAe32Y8xCH0zj@ny2.tmate.io`.
If you still do not want to use the browser manually, simple call `travis::browse()` to open your project on Travis.

Once you are in the build you can use `bash` functions defined by Travis to to execute specific stages:

```{sh eval = FALSE}
travis_run_before_install
travis_run_install
travis_run_before_script
travis_run_script
travis_run_after_success
travis_run_after_failure
travis_run_after_script
```

The debug session is a VM running a [`tmate`](https://tmate.io/) session.
This makes it possible to use `tmux` commands, such as:

- Create multiple windows with `crtl-b c`.  
- Switch to a different window: `crtl-b <window index>` where the indices start with 0, 1, 2 and so on.  
- Scrolling up and down the history: `crtl-b [`. Press `q` to exit the scroll mode.  

See this [cheatsheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) for more shortcuts.

Keep in mind that you only have 30 minutes before the VM will be terminated automatically.

# What's not covered yet?

- `SystemRequirements`: *tic* is not yet capable of automatically determining system requirements specified in DESCRIPTION files of an R package. 
Our plan is to automatically provide suggestions like "Please add `addons: apt: <library>` to `.travis.yml`".
